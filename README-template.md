## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/show the answer to a question when the question is clicked.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Flexbox
- Responsive layout with media queries
- JavaScript DOM manipulation
- Mobile-first workflow

---

### What I Learned

- ✅ How to use `window.getComputedStyle()` to check the actual visibility of an element, instead of relying on `.style.display`.
- ✅ How to structure and toggle elements dynamically using `querySelectorAll`, loops, and event listeners.
- ✅ How to switch background images using media queries for mobile vs desktop.
- ✅ Improved understanding of how browser default styles can affect elements like `<hr>`, and how to reset and style them manually.
